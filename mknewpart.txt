make new partition
====================
fsck -N /dev/sdc1
fsck.ext4 -v /dev/sdc1
mke2fs -n /dev/sdc1
*Superblock backups stored on blocks:
32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208*
Pick an alternate superblock - keep in mind that the first one is the default and its bad so let's not use that one. 
You will also want to pick one from the list you get from your partition. Do not use the example. Your superblocks may be stored elsewhere.

e2fsck -b 98304 /dev/sdc1
Reboot and see if this worked. If not try the next superblock on the list. 
I've had to go the third or fourth one a couple of times.

e2fsck -b 163840 /dev/sdc1
Now try the command to validate the disk again. 
See if you get the same messabout about bad superblocks.

fsck.ext4 -v /dev/sdc1
Keep trying until you either run out of superblocks or it works. 
If you run out, you likely have bigger issues and 
I hope you have good backups. You can try running FSCK at that point.
